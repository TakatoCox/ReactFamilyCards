# ReactFamilyCards

What is it?

This application keeps track of the location, weather and time of each one of my family members in my entire faimly tree. 
Depending on their weather conditions, the color of the card chanegs. 

How does it work?

Each cards is pulling weather data from OpenWeatherMap api and diplaying the weather conditions at their location.
The cards also have a clock set to the time of their location, depending on their timezone.

What did I learn?

I learned how to fetch data from an api and how to diplay them in individual components. 
Using props and hooks, I was able to ditrubute the data into individual components based on the location of
my family member
